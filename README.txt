Challenge 2: Multiclass Classification of Anti-CRISPR Proteins
Anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins inhibit the CRISPR-Cas systems and are being explored
to enhance the precision and safety of gene editing, for example in therapeutic applications 
in cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). 
These proteins can prevent the Cas-gRNA complex from binding to DNA or 
deactivate the Cas effector, thereby reducing off-target effects. 
However, classifying Acr proteins remains a challenge, 
especially for novel Acrs that lack sequence homology to already known proteins.
Traditional methods, such as sequence alignment and manual curation, are time-consuming and
may not capture functional similarities across diverse Acr families.
Machine learning (ML) presents a promising solution to classify both known and 
novel Acr proteins into functional classes. 
However, developing accurate models is complicated by high sequence diversity, 
data imbalance, and limited labeled data. 
Some Acr families are underrepresented, leading to class imbalance,
while many Acr proteins lack clear functional annotations. 
The goal is to develop a robust, ML-based multiclass classification model
capable of handling equence variability and class imbalance, 
while also predicting functional classes for novel Acrs
without requiring extensive sequence homology. 
This could be implemented in the curATime project curATarget.

The challenge is to develop a data-driven classification solution for 
identifying new anti- CRISPR proteins. 
This solution could involve using traditional sequence encoders 
combined with machine learning (ML) or deep learning classifiers, 
as well as hierarchical or ensemble models to capture relationships among different Acr families.
Such a model would streamline Acr protein identification,
reduce the need for manual curation,
and support both academic research and therapeutic applications of CRISPR technology.
Additionally, it would provide valuable insights into CRISPR resistance mechanisms
and guide the design of Acr-based CRISPR modulators.
